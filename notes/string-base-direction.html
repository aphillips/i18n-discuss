<h1>Support for bidi text in strings</h1>
<p style="color:red; font-size: 120%;">This is a draft for to promote discussion and to work through ideas, and may be updated at any time.</p>
<section id="problem">
  <h2>Problem statement</h2>
  <p>When a string contains text in a script that runs right-to-left (RTL), it must be possible to eventually display that string correctly when it reaches an end user. For that to happen, it is necessary to establish what 'base direction' needs to be applied to the string. The appropriate base direction may not always be deduced by simply looking at the string, and if it were possible, the producer and consumer of the string need to use the same heuristics to interpret its direction.</p>
</section>


<section id="litmus">
  <h2>Litmus tests</h2>
  <p>If your specification or application provides a way of correctly displaying the following strings when they reach the point of display to the user, you will have solved the problem. For that to happen, there must be a way to communicate  the required base direction for this string.</p>
  <p>All examples show characters from left to right in the order they are stored in memory. We use Hebrew text so as to avoid issues related to the display of cursive characters in Arabic. Tests 1-4 need to be displayed with a RTL base direction.</p>
  
<section id="test1">
  <h3>Test #1</h3>
  <p dir="rtl" style="text-align:center;"><code><bdo dir="ltr">&quot;בינלאומי!&quot;</bdo></code></p>
  <p>The order of the Hebrew letters should be produced automatically by the Unicode Bidi Algorithm (UBA), but the exclamation mark must appear to the left of the text when displayed in a LTR context.</p>
</section>
<section id="test2">
  <h3>Test #2</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>
    <bdo dir="ltr">&quot;#bidi בינלאומי&quot;</bdo>
  </code></p>
  <p>The text &quot;bidi&quot; must appear to the right of the Hebrew letters.<code></code></p>
</section>

<section id="test3">
  <h3>Test #3</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code><bdo dir="ltr">&quot;&lt;span&gt;בינלאומי!&lt;/span&gt;&quot;</bdo></code></p>
  <p>The exclamation mark must appear to the left of the Arabic letters if the consuming application treats the markup as actual markup., ie. the markup should be ignored.</p>
</section>

<section id="test4">
  <h3>Test #4</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code>
    <bdo dir="ltr">&quot;&lt;span dir='rtl'&gt;one שתיים three&lt;/span&gt;&quot;</bdo></code></p>
  <p>If the consuming application is expected to parse the markup as actual markup, the list should be displayed in the order &quot;three שתיים one&quot;.<code></code></p>
</section>

<section id="test5">
  <h3>Test #5</h3>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><code><bdo dir="ltr">&quot;123 456 789&quot;</bdo></code></p>
  <p>The order of the numbers must remain the same, regardless of the directional context of the surrounding text, and must go from left to right.<code></code></p>

<section id="ancilliary">
  <h2>Ancilliary issues</h2>
  <p>The following are things that need to be considered for an end to end process that supports proper application of base direction to strings, but they are not within the scope the various strategies for transporting the base direction value of a string from point A to point B.</p>

<section id="producers">
  <h3>Producing</h3>
  <p>When a  string is captured as a string, it's necessary to (a) detect the appropriate base direction to be associated with the string, and (b) take steps, where needed, to set the string up in a way that communicates the base direction.  </p>
  <p><code></code>In the case of a string that is extracted from an HTML form, this would require detection of the computed value of the form field's direction. Such a value could be inherited from an earlier element, such as the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> element, or set using markup or styling on the <code class="kw" translate="no">input</code> element itself. The user could also set the direction of the text by using the keyboard to change the direction of the form field.</p>
  <p>If the producer of the string is receiving the string from a location where it was stored by another producer, and where the base direction has already been established, the producer should understand that the base direction has already been set.</p>
</section>

<section id="consumers">
  <h3>Consuming</h3>
  <p>The application or process that takes a string and places it into a context where it will be exposed to a user must ensure that the base direction of the string is correctly applied to the string in that context. This may involve constructing additional markup or adding control codes or some such to indicate the base direction. It should also isolate embedded strings from the surrounding text to avoid spill-over effects of the bidi algorithm.</p>
  <p>More importantly, the consumer, when it receives a string, must know how to decode the indicators that relay the expected base direction for the string. These indicators must correlate with the expectations set by the producer of the string.</p>
</section>

</section>



<section id="firststrong">
  <h2>First-strong</h2>
  <p> if you are relying solely on first-strong character detection to establish the contextual base direction of a string, the consumer needs to be aware that it should also use the same approach. Note that first-strong detection is not the only possible higher level protocol for detecting string direction that is outlined in the UBA. Ultimately, however, first-strong detection alone is not sufficient to communicate base direction, as you will see.</p>
  <p>The detection algorithm needs to skip characters at the start of the string that don't have a strong directional property.</p>
  <p>It also needs to skip embedded runs of text that are directionally isolated from the text around it, if it is to follow the UBA. Isolation may be achieved by Unicode formatting characters, such as RLI, LRI and FSI, or by markup in the string if that markup is to be interpreted as actual markup by the consumer (eg. &lt;span dir=&quot;rtl&quot;&gt; in HTML5).</p>
  <p>Any markup at the start of the string that should be interpreted as actual markup by the consumer must also be skipped when searching for the first strong directional character. If, however, there is angle bracket content that is intended to be an example of markup, rather than actual markup, the markup must not be skipped. It isn't clear how a consumer of the string would know the difference between this case and the previous one when relying only on first-strong detection.</p>
  <p>If actual markup in the string contains information about the intended direction of the string, that information should be used rather than relying on first-strong heuristics. This is problematic in a couple of ways: (a) it assumes that the consumer of the string understands the semantics of the markup, which may be ok if there is an agreement between all parties to use, say, HTML markup only, but would be problematic when dealing with random XML vocabularies, and (b) the consumer must be able to to recognise and handle a situation where only the intial part of the string has markup, ie. the markup applies to an inline span of text rather than the string as a whole.</p>
  <p>If no strong directional character is found in the string, the direction should be assumed to be LTR.</p>
  <p>Last, but by no means least, first-strong heuristics will fail where the first strong character is not representative of the base direction that needs to be applied to that string, such as in test #2 above.</p>
</section>




<section id="rlm">
  <h2>RLM markers</h2>
  <p>It is possible to attach an RLM/LRM code point to the beginning of  those strings where the wrong base direction would be assumed if first-strong yields an incorrect result. This is a variant of the first-strong heuristic approach where action is taken to place an appropriate first character into the string where needed. It assumes that the consumer will also use first-strong detection to establish the base direction of the string.</p>
  <p>This approach is only appropriate if it is acceptable to change the value of the string.</p>
  <p>If directional information is contained in markup (eg. <code class="kw" translate="no">dir=rtl</code> in HTML), either the producer or the consumer of a string should understand that markup in order to set or not set an RLM/LRM character as appropriate.</p>
  <p>The producer of a string should not automatically apply RLM or LRM to the start of the string, but  should test whether it is needed. For example, if there's already an RLM there, no need to add another. If the context is correctly conveyed by first-strong heuristics, no need to add additional characters either. Note, however, that testing whether directional information is needed is only possible if the producer has access, and knows that it has access, to the original context of the string.</p>
</section>




<section id="paired">
  <h2>Paired formatting characters</h2>
  <p>This approach inserts paired Unicode formatting characters at the start and end of a string to indicate the base direction. It is problematic and is NOT recommended. </p>
  <p>If paired formatting characters are used, they should be isolating, ie. RLI, LRI, FSI.</p>
  <p>The Unicode bidi algorithm is unable to ascertain the base direction for a string that starts with RLI/LRI/FSI and ends with PDI, since the algorithm skips over isolated sequences and treats them the same as a neutral character.  A consumer of the string would have to take special steps, in this case, to uncover the first-strong character. It would not be enough to simply apply the UBA first-strong heuristics.</p>
  <p>Unicode specifies a limit to the number of embeddings that are effective, and embeddings could build up over time to exceed that limit.</p>
  <p>Consuming applications would need to recognise and appropriately handle the isolating formatting characters. At the moment such support is not pervasive.</p>
  <p>A  producer and a consumer of a string would need to recognise and handle a situation where a string begins with a paired formatting character but doesn't end with it – either through truncation or omission, or simply because the formatting characters only describe a part of the string. </p>
</section>



<section id="metadata">
  <h2>Metadata</h2>
  <p>If it is possible to pass metadata with the string and the consumer is able to detect that metadata, this can provide a simple method of communicating the intended base direction without affecting the actual content of the string.</p>
  <p>There needs to be metadata available for each individual string. Alternatively, metadata can be inherited, but some mechanism must be available to override the inherited direction for a particular string which differs in direction from the inherited value.</p>
  <p>Use of metadata also removes the question of whether the string has or has not been modified to reflect the intended base direction. If there is metadata, then that process has already been gone through.</p>
  <p>It also removes the problem of whether or not to parse the markup in a string to determine the direction, as long as the producer of the string has set the metadata correctly.</p>
